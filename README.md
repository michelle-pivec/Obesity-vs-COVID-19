Analysis of COVID-19 Deaths and Obesity in the United States
This analysis is the final project for the Data Analytics program through Career Foundry. The goal of this achievement is to perform a full data analysis on a topic of our choosing. The analysis consisted of sourcing our own data, performing data quality measures, data cleaning and wranging, and analysis using a variety of tools including Excel, Tableau, SQL, and Python. The final produce includes a Tableau storyboard, a GitHub repository, and an addition to our data portfolio. 

Data was sourced mainly from the CDC and US Census Bureau. Data quality, cleaning, and wrangling were performed using a variety of techniques which can be found within this repository.
